# Simon - Memory Game
---

### History

#### Simon Electronic Game, 1978

Named for the children’s game “Simon Says,” inventors Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison created the game Simon. Their inspiration for the game came from an arcade game called _Touch Me_ made by Atari. The two felt the game had potential if created propely with pleasant sounds. Simon had four different colored buttons (red, green, blue and yellow) which each play a different sound when pressed. The original game was released by Milton Bradley in 1978 including a release party at Studio 54, the elite disco in NYC [^fn]
